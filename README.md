# DayZ-Reasonably-Priced-Vanilla-Expansion-Mod-Market-Files
These are the Vanilla + Expansion item Expansion Market & Trader files. Everything has been priced fairly close to reality to keep the server Economy more realistic.

SIDE NOTE ON HELICOPTERS (and a little preaching)

There is a Helicopter Parts Trader entry but it is not needed unless you want a specific parts dealer, say for ARMA or RFFS Helicopters & parts. 
DO NOT PUT IT IN YOUR TRADER FOLDER IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC PARTS TRADER SET UP. 

The regular Aircraft Trader is configured to sell the Helicopters & parts, not buy them. You will see the category is set to 0

0 = Can only be bought from this trader, but not sold: https://github.com/salutesh/DayZ-Expansion-Scripts/wiki/%5BServer-Hosting%5D-Trader-Settings

This stops players from swooping to NWAF or Balota and grabbing a Helicopter to sell and make a mint. If you allow this, it will fuck your economy.
Helicopters also allow players to totally bypass anything you've created in the map to flesh out your DayZ world - it lets them immediately fly to
end-game, high tier events rather than slug it out running/walking or at least driving to places.

If you allow lots of helicopters, you create giant loot crates where players can land at VMC or Tisy, loot the shit out of them and fly back to Green
Mountain to rake in cash. You also box yourself into making only mega events that people will fly to instead of being able to flesh out out towns and 
cities with AI or Zombie encounters for people to find when they have to travel by land. At least cars can be stopped by an AI roadbloack. Helicopters?
Nope. Your players will just be flying right over the top of all your hard work...

PS. Don't debate me on prices. Just change them to what you want.
